## About me

I grew up on the unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh, commonly referred to as Vancouver, British Columbia and am thrilled to continue to work and learn here. I am a current graduate student at the University of British Columbia in the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management program. I was drawn to this program as it furthers my ambitions of approaching community-based research topics through the lens remote sensing and environment statistics. I have had the privilege of studying on the unceded territory of the Miâ€™kmaq, referred to as Halifax, Nova Scotia. I attended Dalhousie University from 2021 to 2024 and completed an Honours BSc in Environmental Science with a minor in Statistics. Returning to the west coast was a priority for me as it is a place that represents family and holds a sense of belonging. I hope to apply the knowledge I gain to the protection and management of British Columbian forests, and empowerment of communities.
