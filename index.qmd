## About me

I grew up on the unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh, commonly known as Vancouver, and Iâ€™m excited to continue my work and studies here. I am currently pursuing a Master's in Geomatics for Environmental Management at the University of British Columbia, following an Honours BSc in Environmental Science with a Statistics minor from Dalhousie University. Returning to the West Coast feels like home, and I am passionate about applying my skills in remote sensing and environmental statistics to support forest protection and community empowerment in British Columbia.

When I'm not in the lab, you can find me kayaking Deep Cove, hiking Lynn Valley, or crocheting at home.
